# Clicky Game App

This is an application that uses React, JSX, HTML and CSS.<br>

This web application is a game where the user clicks on the images and get a score depending on the rules of the game.<br>

When the application starts, it displays a message for the user with the instructions of the game as well as it displays a set of images. The main rule of the game is to click on the images one at a time and to make sure not to click on the same image twice in a row. When user clicks on an image, the application shuffles the images so that it makes it difficult for the user to remember which image was clicked. Every time the user clicks on an image, the user scores a point. If the user clicks on the same image twice in a row, the score resets to 0.<br>
